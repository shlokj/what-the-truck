# What the Truck

## Overview

What the Truck is a web platform for UCLA students living on the Hill to rate and review food trucks.

UCLA dining only gives us a list of food trucks, not information on the food they serve as they do for their dining halls. On talking to several others, we realized that many students would find a source of information on every day's food trucks useful. We take it a step further - not only do we enable students to share food truck menus, but even rate and review food trucks and share pictures of the food.

## Features

### 1. Read reviews about food trucks

See what others are saying about food trucks on the Hill and avoid a bad meal. Scroll through pictures and browse through what your peers think about every  single food truck on the Hill.

### 2. Share your experiences

Recommend the best food trucks to eat at or criticize you didn't particularly enjoy. Upload pictures of the food, the menu, and anything else. You can choose to be anonymous: our app does not expose the email you used to sign up but instead uses a username you pick.

### 3. See the best food trucks today and all-time

We strive to make our service a one-stop destination for everything UCLA food trucks. It periodically monitors UCLA's official dining page and tells you the highest-rated food trucks available today. You can even search for trucks serving cuisines you're looking for.

## Running the App

### Clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/shlokj/what-the-truck`

Or, just download a zip directly through GitHub and extract it locally.

### Enter the directory

`cd what-the-truck`

### Install the dependencies

`npm i` or `npm install`

FYI: We initially decided to build this app entirely on the MERN stack, which means we had the frontend and backend in separate folders. We modified the `package.json` so that the normal npm scripts would perform the necessary operations on both the backend and frontend. `npm i` actually installs dependencies in subfolders, not in the root.

### Run the app

`npm start`

Similar to the previous FYI, this script has been modified.

### Explore and enjoy!
